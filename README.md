Created a full workflow: load → clean → feature engineering → modeling → clustering → insights.

Added feature engineering (e.g., vehicle age from model year) and robust preprocessing (numeric + categorical handling).

Included model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²) and segmentation (clustering) for deeper insights.

Made it easy to plug into Google Colab: with placeholders and checks so you just update your file name/columns.
